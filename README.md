Circuit design DE project

This circuit is designed to monitor water levels in two tanks using three sensors, represented by switches A, B, and C. The primary function is to control a water pump, indicated by an LED, based on the water levels detected by these sensors. Each sensor corresponds to different water levels: A for low, B for medium, and C for high. The circuit processes these sensor inputs through a series of logic gates to determine the current water level in each tank. If the water level in either tank is low or empty, the circuit will turn on the water pump, lighting up the LED. Conversely, if the water levels in both tanks are sufficient (medium or full), the circuit will turn off the water pump, causing the LED to go off. This system ensures efficient and automated water management by continuously monitoring and responding to the water levels in the tanks.
